FullStackOpen course, part 3!

This was originally a plain hello world repository - the 1st one in the course, and
I'm sad to say that I *still* need help with git and getting my head around it, but
for part 3 of the course it was recommended to have this in a totally separate repo,
and as far as I know, that's what I'm doing now.

Fly.io version opened by command `fly open`.
