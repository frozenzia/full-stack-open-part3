Trying the full stack course

My name is Paul Brown, I'm a 51-yr-old dude at this point and working on this course with my son Milo. We're gonna **try** and get thru it before the deadline in December.

I am adding a few words of text via labs.play-with-docker.com. Need to be sure that I can set things up from here if need be.

 - list 1
 - list 2

Maybe.
